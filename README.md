#### C# Web API with 2 WPF client application.

## DoctorClient

[Github Pages](https://notusedusername.github.io/doctorCSharp/)

Select the next patient, and modify his/her profile, check the complaint and set up a diagnosis. The list is ordered by arrival.
If there are no patients in the waiting room currently, then the application will re-check it in every 5 seconds.
If a patient wants to visit another doctor from now, then you can delete all of his/her data with a single click!
(Well with 2, because you have to confirm this risky action.)
